/*
Problem Statement:

Given a 2D grid where:
- 0 represents land
- 1 represents water

A "closed island" is a group of 0s completely surrounded by 1s on all sides
(including diagonally not allowed) and does not touch the boundary.

Return the number of closed islands.

Time Complexity: O(M * N)
Space Complexity: O(M * N)
